<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>This taps into my imagination and desire to explore the cosmos</p>
<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>Controversial take: Arnold's best role. He was born to be this bad guy.</p>
<h3>Love Actually</h3>
<p>My top #1 Christmas movie. It just plain ol makes me happy. Hugh Grant ftw.</p>
