<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Michael Case and I'm a software developer specializing in web design. I enjoy taking real world
  problems and solving them with coded solutions that present to the user in a good looking fashion. Making previously
  manully handled problems simpler, more understandable, and generally less of a problem is what makes me happy. I take
  extra joy when the solution looks good performing its new job as well!</p>

<p>I have a lot of experience using javascript and in recent years typescript along with c# injesting data and doing useful
  things with it. A lot can be achieved when you're able to pull data from disparate sources and do smart things with it. To
  do smart things with it, you need to understand what the desired outcome is. Figuring out what people or organizations need
  has also become an area of focus and expertise over the years.
</p>

<p>Besides solving problems with code, I have several other personal interests, includeing:
  <ul>
    <li>Real Estate</li>
    <li>Stocks and investing</li>
    <li>Electric Vehicles (particularly Tesla)</li>
    <li>Space</li>
    <li>Golf and Tennis</li>
    <li>Travel</li>
    <li>Spending time with my kid and teaching her about the world</li>
  </ul>
